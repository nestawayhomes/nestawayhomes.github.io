Thank you for your interest in becoming a private money lender!

Private money lending can be a relatively low-risk, high-yield way to invest your money. Unlike real estate investing which can require a fair amount of industry and market knowledge (and time!) in order to maximize profits, private money lending is a more passive way to invest your money because you don’t have to be a landlord, manage “fix and flip” projects, or hold real estate for long periods of time to realize solid returns. 

Our notes are for less than twelve months. This short-term arrangement gives your investments similar liquidity as CDs but with much better interest rates!
