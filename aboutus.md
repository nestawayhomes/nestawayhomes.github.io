Hi! We're James & Kat. Full time software engineers and real estate investors. We live in Seattle with our three cats, Jason, Nori and Mukkuru. We love to talk about cats, food and real estate!

### Our story
Katâ€™s real estate journey began in San Diego in 2018 where she bought two properties, house hacking and renting rooms to students to cover her housing expenses. She was convinced that the next step was investing in cash flowing assets out of state.

James had a different path. He initially invested in ETFs, believing in the long term steady returns. After meeting Kat, she suggested he read *[Set for Life](https://amzn.to/3sflifG)*. He didn't need much more convincing.

We spent a year learning about real estate, researching markets and setting up processes before deciding on Indianapolis. Once the decision was made, it was only a matter of time before we each bought our first property in late 2019.

After that, it was full speed ahead. In 2020, we grew our portfolio to thirteen doors. In 2021, we expanded to short term rentals and Louisville, KY.

### <br>Nest Away
###### <br>Nest Away Homes
The *Nest Away* name was born from our desire to provide safe and quality homes to others. We aim to put our full effort into every project and pride ourselves on the results. For us, it's not about cutting corners and calling it a job well done; we want to create a home our tenants can be proud of. We believe that people take better care of their home if we show the same level of care in our work. Each project is treated as our home, hence the name *Nest Away Homes*.

###### Nest Away Stays
*Nest Away Stays* is our **short term rental** design and management company. Our vision is to build a brand that guests can trust, across cities and eventually countries. Just as *Nest Away Homes* signals our mission to provide safe and quality homes to others, *Nest Away Stays* is our commitment to a consistent, comfortable and memorable experience.  We want all our guests to feel at home, no matter which property they stay at. When you stay with *Nest Away Stays*, you know that everything was carefully considered and tastefully designed with a focus on hospitality and quality guest experience.

###### Nest Away Cafe
The cafe is a place for us to share our thoughts, experiences, and learnings over the course of our real estate journey. It's a place where we aim to educate and provide value to give back to the community that did the same for us.
