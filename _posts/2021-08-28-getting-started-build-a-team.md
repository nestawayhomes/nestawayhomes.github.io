You have a market and a strategy in mind, how do you start putting the pieces together? The answer is you need a team. A team who you trust and who are far better than you in their specialized field. Without a competant team, you will find yourself rolling the dice far more than you'd want

### The Team
At your team's core, you will need an agent, a general contractor and a property manager. To support them, you may end up with an insurance broker, title company, attorney, inspector and others.
