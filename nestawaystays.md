title: Nest Away Stays

Nest Away Stays is our **short term rental** management vision. We have a vision to build a brand that guests can trust, across cities and eventually countries.

The name explains it all. We want guests to feel at home, no matter which property they stay at. We believe guests notice when you provide a consistent, comfortable and memorable experience. When you stay with Nest Away Stays, you know that everything was carefully considered and tastefully designed.

### Our story

We had always toyed with the thought of starting a short term rental but never found the right time. Nest Away Stays was born out of a need to minimize our housing expense in Seattle. Initially, we were unable to find any properties where long term rents would make sense compared to renting. At some point, we realized Airbnb could be an option.

After starting our first short term rental, [Emerald City Retreat](https://airbnb.com/h/nestawayseattle), we realized the processes were scalable. That's when we started exploring other markets and quickly expanded to Louisville, KY. The kentucky derby, the bourbon trail, historic locations, Muhammad Ali, the list goes on!
